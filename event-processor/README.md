# Event Processor

A Go service that processes learning platform events and publishes them to Kafka. This service acts as an event gateway, receiving events via HTTP and publishing them to a Kafka topic for further processing by other services.

## Features

- HTTP API for receiving events
- Kafka event publishing
- Health check endpoint
- Configurable via environment variables
- Graceful shutdown handling

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Access to a Kafka broker (see root project for Kafka setup)

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/event-processor.git
cd event-processor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod download
```

3. Run the service:
```bash
go run main.go
```

The service will start on port 8081 by default and connect to Kafka at localhost:9092.

## Environment Variables

The service can be configured using the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `PORT` | HTTP server port | `8081` |
| `KAFKA_BROKERS` | Comma-separated list of Kafka broker addresses | `localhost:9092` |
| `KAFKA_TOPIC` | Kafka topic name for events | `learning-events` |

Example:
```bash
export PORT=8080
export KAFKA_BROKERS=kafka1:9092,kafka2:9092
export KAFKA_TOPIC=learning-events
export DEBUG=1 # if needed
go run main.go
```
